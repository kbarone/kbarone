### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I am a computer science and public policy graduate student at the University of Chicago. I enjoy working on machine learning projects that give us more information about our physical world and the people in it. Currently, Iâ€™m working as a Machine Learning Research Assistant on a project using convolutional neural nets to predict the collision likelihood for Venus and Mercury. I'm also enjoying learning more about how we can use modern computer vision techniques to analyze satellite imagery.
